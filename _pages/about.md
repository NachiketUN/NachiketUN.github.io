Welcome to my website!

I am a Software Engineer at [Visa Inc](https://www.visa.co.in/), working on P2P Push Payment Flows in the Visa Direct Team. Previously I interned at JP Morgan Chase Bangalore, India.

I finished my undergrad in Information Technology at the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) (NITK Surathkal) in June 2020. During my undergrad, I was part of the [Healthcare Analytics & Language Engineering (HALE) Lab](https://halelabnitk.github.io/index.html), where I worked on projects such Patient Similarity and Object Detection on 3D data. Dr. Sowmya Kamath advised me.
